    # ===================== Your Code Here =====================
    # Instructions : Complete the following code to make predictions using
    #                your learned logistic regression parameters (one vs all).
    #                You should set p to a vector of predictions (from 1 to
    #                num_labels)
    #
    # Hint : This code can be done all vectorized using the max function
    #        In particular, the max function can also return the index of the
    #        max element, for more information see 'np.argmax' function.
    #
    p = np.argmax(X @ all_theta.T,axis=1)
    return p
