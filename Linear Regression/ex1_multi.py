# ===================== Part 2: Gradient Descent =====================

# ===================== Your Code Here =====================
# Instructions : We have provided you with the following starter
#                code that runs gradient descent with a particular
#                learning rate (alpha).
#
#                Your task is to first make sure that your functions -
#                computeCost and gradientDescent already work with
#                this starter code and support multiple variables.
#
#                After that, try running gradient descent with
#                different values of alpha and see which one gives
#                you the best result.
#
#                Finally, you should complete the code at the end
#                to predict the price of a 1650 sq-ft, 3 br house.
#
# Hint: At prediction, make sure you do the same feature normalization.
#

# Plot the convergence graph

plt.plot(np.arange(J_history.size), J_history)
plt.xlabel('Number of iterations')
plt.ylabel('Cost J')

# Display gradient descent's result
print('Theta computed from gradient descent : \n{}'.format(theta))

# Estimate the price of a 1650 sq-ft, 3 br house
# ===================== Your Code Here =====================
# Recall that the first column of X is all-ones. Thus, it does
# not need to be normalized.

# ===================== Part 3: Normal Equations =====================

print('Solving with normal equations ...')

# ===================== Your Code Here =====================
# Instructions : The following code computes the closed form
#                solution for linear regression using the normal
#                equations. You should complete the code in
#                normalEqn.py
#
#                After doing so, you should complete this code
#                to predict the price of a 1650 sq-ft, 3 br house.
